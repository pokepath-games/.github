# [PokéPath TD](https://pokepath.games/) — Free Pokémon Tower Defense

**Play PokéPath TD in your browser or download the desktop build on itch.io.** PokéPath TD blends tower-defense tactics with Pokémon-style progression: build a team, level and evolve units mid-run, and keep persistent growth across runs. Use Auto Mode for AFK farming and export saves to back up progress.

## What is [PokePath](https://pokepath.games/) TD
PokéPath TD is a free browser tower-defense game featuring nine unique routes, in-run leveling and evolution, and persistent progression between runs. You manage a roster of units, place them strategically, and spend coins during waves to power up your team. Ideal for both short tactical sessions and long-term AFK progression.

## Key Features
- **9 Routes** — Distinct layouts, enemy types and bosses that demand different strategies.  
- **Mid-run Leveling & Evolution** — Spend in-run coins to create tactical power spikes when needed.  
- **Persistent Progression** — Unlocks and growth carry over between runs.  
- **Auto Mode & Speed Controls** — Automate runs for AFK farming and accelerate progression.  
- **Export / Import Saves** — Backup your progress by exporting a JSON save file.

## Quick Start — 4 Simple Steps
1. **Pick a Route** — Choose a map that fits your team composition and goals.  
2. **Build & Position** — Place units where they control chokepoints and cover multiple paths.  
3. **Upgrade During Runs** — Use coins at critical moments (e.g., before boss waves) to upgrade/evolve key units.  
4. **Use Auto Mode** — Once you find a reliable route and setup, enable Auto to farm resources passively.

## Practical Strategy Tips
- **Type Matchups Matter**: Build a team with complementary types to handle varied enemies.  
- **Positioning > Quantity**: Place high-value or area-effect units where they hit the most path traffic.  
- **Spend Smartly**: Save for pivotal upgrades (boss or late-wave power spikes). Early economy management pays off.  
- **Test Then Farm**: Use manual runs to confirm a setup, then switch to Auto for repeated farming.  
- **Backup Often**: Export your save regularly — browser storage can be cleared by updates or cache cleaning.  
- **Low-End Devices**: Enable low-graphics or performance mode to improve stability on weaker hardware.

## Controls & Shortcuts
- **Place / Select unit**: Left-click  
- **Cancel placement**: Right-click  
- **Quick slots (0–9)**: Press corresponding number  
- **Next wave**: `Space`
